Introduction to PHP
PHP, also known as Hypertext Preprocessor, is a powerful scripting language used predominantly for
creating dynamic web pages and applications. It provides seamless interaction with databases, 
easier control of content, session tracking, and cookies. Being an open-source language, it’s favored by developers for its flexibility, speed, and security.
